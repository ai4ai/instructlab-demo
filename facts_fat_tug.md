# Fat Tug IPA by Driftwood Brewing

## Description
Driftwood's Fat Tug IPA is a Northwest-style India Pale Ale brewed by Driftwood Brewery. This bold and flavorful beer boasts a 7% ABV and over 80 IBUs, making it a hop-forward experience. The appearance is a hazy golden orange, inviting the drinker to explore its complex aroma profile.

On the nose, Fat Tug IPA offers a bouquet of tropical and citrus fruits, including grapefruit, mango, melon, and passionfruit. The taste is decidedly hoppy, citrusy, and bitter, showcasing the beer's impressive hop bill. Driftwood uses a combination of Cascade, Columbus, Centennial, Amarillo, and Citra hops to achieve this intense flavor profile.

The malt backbone, while not overpowering, provides balance with a blend of Pilsner, Crystal, and Carapils malts. This combination supports the hop character while adding depth to the overall flavor.

Fat Tug IPA pairs exceptionally well with bold flavors. Recommended food pairings include strong cheeses, shellfish, sashimi, spicy Asian cuisine, and Mexican food. These pairings complement the beer's intense hop profile and help cut through its bitterness.

This award-winning IPA has become a flagship beer for Driftwood Brewery and a favorite among craft beer enthusiasts who appreciate a well-crafted, hop-forward ale.
